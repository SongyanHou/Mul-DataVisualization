Mul-DataVisualization
=====================

This app on Android Platform could visualize six-dimensional motion data from the sensors in devices (3-axis accelerometer and 3-axis gyroscope). The core of this application is to utilize the geometrical properties of cuboid (length of side and rotation angles around each axis) to display the motion data. Besides, it could also help to express devicesâ€™ trend of motion variation by showing the trace that the target device just went through, which is beneficial for future data mining.

Additionally, this application also gets function extended by introducing a new dimension in the visualization results. This newly displayed dimension could aid us better for comprehending the motion tendency of the device.
